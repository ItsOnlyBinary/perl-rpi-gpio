NAME
    RPi::GPIO - GPIO Access for Raspberry Pi

SYNOPSIS
        use RPi::GPIO;
        my $gpio = RPi::GPIO->new(MODE => 'PIN');
        $gpio->setup(11,'INPUT');
        $gpio->setup(12,'OUTPUT');
        my $value = $gpio->input(11);
        print "INPUT 11 = $value\n";
        $gpio->setup(12, $value);

DESCRIPTION
    Simple use of Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins

USAGE
  new(MODE => $mode, PIN => @pin, BCM => @bcm)
    Create new RPi:GPIO instance.
        PATH - Path to gpio
        default: /sys/class/gpio/
    
        MODE - GPIO Access Method:
        PIN: Raspberry Pi's GPIO pin numbers.
        BCM: Raspberry Pi's Broadcom GPIO designation.

        PIN - Set Raspberry Pi PIN -> BCM map
        [undef, undef, undef, 0, undef, 1, undef, 4, 14, undef, 15, 17, 18, 21, undef, 22, 23, undef, 24, 10, undef, 9, 25, 11, 8, undef, 7]
        NOTE: the first undef is for array[0] as the RPi starts at PIN 1

        BCM - List of BCM GPIO designations
        [0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]

        returns: $self

  setup($channel, $direction)
    Register a GPIO channel and set its direction
        $channel = PIN or BCM designation depending on mode
        $direction = IN or OUT
        returns: 1 success, 0 fail

  input($channel)
    Get GPIO's current state
        $channel = PIN or BCM designation depending on mode
        returns: 0,1 or undef if failed

  output($channel, $value)
    Set GPIO's current state
        $channel = PIN or BCM designation depending on mode
        $value = 0 or 1
        returns: 1 success, 0 fail

  remove($channel)
    remove a gpio channel
        $channel = PIN or BCM designation depending on mode
        if $channel = 'ALL' it will remove all

BUGS
    If there are none I will be surprised and always room for improvement
